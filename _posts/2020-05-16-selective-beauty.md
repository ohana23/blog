We're very selective about what we call beautiful. Take ocean life for example. We call turtles and dolphins and whales beautiful. We show them hurt in commercials as we advocate to protect them. We would never purposefully mean to harm them. Then, look at our relationship with run-of-the-mill fish, crustaceans, and other food "delicacies". We kill and eat them. We call them beautiful and fascinating as well but we don't mean it the same way. We'll kill in the same breath.

Here's what I'm __not__ saying. I'm not saying eating animals like fish and things like that is despicable and punishable.

What I __am__ saying is, as humans, we tell ourselves these stories about what is beautiful and what isn't. We're convinced that a tuna has less value than a tortoise. A cow less value than a cat. And on the subject of race in people, a Native American less value than a Norwegian.

Humans are not just racist. They're mammalist and fishist. They're everything -ist. The only times these -ist's are seen as gross and evil is when society as a unit decides so.

The truth is, everything is beautiful. We just have to look at things for what they are. Not for what we've been told they are. Decide for ourselves and be optimistic in everything's value.
