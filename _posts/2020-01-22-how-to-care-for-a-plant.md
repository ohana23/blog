**Give your plants plenty of light**. One of the primary concerns for house plants is making sure they get enough light[^1]. Keeping your plants on a side-table in your living room may look good, but if it is too far from a window, your plant may not last long. Look up the sun requirements for your specific plant, and move them to a location that matches those requirements. Keep in mind that windows facing the south side of your house will receive the most light, while windows facing the north side will receive the least amount of light. Basic sunshine guidelines are as follows:

Plants that need:
- **full sunlight** should be placed somewhere that gets 4-6 hours of direct light per day.
- **partial sunlight** should be placed somewhere that gets 2-3 hours of direct light per day.
- **shade** should be placed somewhere that gets 1 hour of direct sunlight per day.

These are the next steps.

1. Write the press release
2. Update the website
3. Contact the media
