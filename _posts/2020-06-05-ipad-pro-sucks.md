"Why", you ask?

Because it's too damn good.

This isn't a joke. The thing is an entertainment machine and I hate it. It's so fun and such a joy to use and, quite frankly, I can't take it anymore.

If the stupid thing is out sitting on a table with its dumb stupid face looking up at me, I'll play with it. It's like one of those tiny dogs that can't help but leave its tongue sticking out, head tilted to the side. What? Am I ___not___ gonna pet it? Of course I am. It's sitting ___right there___.

Tap-to-wake is a big part of the problem.

If the iPad came with anything resembling a traditional instruction manual, which it doesn't because it's an iPad, it might detail the following instructions:

1. Touch it

And boom. Suddenly it's on and it's got you in its tantalizing grasp. You think you're strong enough to check it for just a second, but look at that, it's already showing you 3 Instagram notifications, so just check those really quick. That's all it wants. Oh, and once you're done with that, could you just open up YouTube for ___juuust___ a jiffy? The app icon is bright red and contrasts really well against all your other apps, so since you noticed it, it would really make the most sense to open it up and watch the first 3 videos the algorithm thinks you really ought to spend your next 30 minutes on. Great! Now that you understand how to stack dice with just a cup and know that Krav Maga is the best technique to use for when you'll inevitably need to beat up terrorists and watched a chef try her damnedest to recreate Twizzlers from scratch with nothing but her grit and willingess to do the things that everyone said was impossible (I love you Claire), it's about time to check your Instagram again.

Hmm... no red dots. Check Facebook. It's been over an hour since you last opened it and it's usually pretty good about showing you a nice red dot you can click on, even if all that red dot reveals is a memory from 10 years ago of when you and 45 other people were tagged in a shady Ray-Bans ad with a url which, if entered, will definitely give up all your personal info to someone who truly deserves it because you should not be stupid enough to believe ___free-ray-bans-here.com___ is an actual thing that's safe. (Note: Don't navigate to that, please. I haven't tested it myself.)

You finally look up and turn to the window. Outside, a bright hologram projected up at the sky, or rather, the dark, ominous clouds obscuring the sky. It's the face of Steve Jobs. Under it, it reads "87 years since our savior's departure".

"87 years?", you think to yourself. "I thought he passed like 5 years ago at most." You look back at the iPad and Google "steve jobs death year".

2011, it answers back.

"Huh", you laugh. "Time flies."

"Wait, 87 years? That would make it like...", I Google "2011 + 87".

2098, it answers back.

You stare at it till the screen goes to sleep, and then you look back up at Steve.

"You bastard," you say under your breath. And then you smile, "you damn genius bastard."
