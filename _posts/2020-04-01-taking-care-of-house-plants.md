I wanted to talk a little bit about charisma and how it relates to a seemingly unrelated quote I heard the other day. The quote went something along the lines of: 

>“In a negotiation, the person who cares the least is the person who wins.”

Off the top of my head I don’t remember who said it. But it’s certainly true in most of the negotiations I’ve seen or been a part of. 

In Israel, when I was haggling with a man in the market to buy a corn cob pipe, I didn’t really need it. So, he dropped the price maybe 150 shekels. 

That’s just one example. 

The point is, caring less allows you to remain more confident in a negotiation. You become more sure of yourself if you have little to lose. The man in the market’s main objective was to get rid of his merchandise (he had a lot). When a customer showed to finally buy the pipe, he had to make sure it would go. 

I, on the other hand, was just looking for a gift. I didn’t care much whether or not I could buy that particular pipe. If it was too expensive, fine. I’d go to another shopkeeper and buy something from them. Perhaps a cheaper corn cob pipe. 

Of course, this scenario comes with the caveat that the man in the market I haggled with could have easily been the one to care the least, so long as he figured that surely another customer would come by eventually and buy the pipe. 

But I had the upper hand simply because I believed that I cared less. Consciously or not. 

### Now, I wanted to relate this back to charisma. 

I was wondering if, when it comes to charismatic leaders in movie battles, presidential races, and managerial promotions,  this same idea of caring less comes in handy. 

The leader of a medieval army is probably the oldest or one of the most experienced. This relates to the [Principle of Least Interest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_least_interest). Certainly with age, comes less care. The freshman in college is more keen to impress his peers than the 5th year senior. Likewise the new soldier recruit is nervous and cares a lot, not knowing what to expect from this forthcoming experience.

Do leaders care less?

>It comes down to the fact that caring less and *not giving a shit* in any form of negotiation listed above usually makes you superior, or at least feel so. I should always pretend I’m eating an apple. No one seems to care about anything else when they’re eating an apple.

They say a good leader would do anything for his team, even bite the bullet from higher ups. But are they more willing to do so in part because they’ve learned to care little about what higher ups think, at least when compared to their inferiors?

### Can you become the leader of a group by caring the least?

I’ve certainly felt most confident when I feel a sense of superiority among my group, though perhaps unjustifiably. I’m funnier, more likable, and more pleasant to be around when I don’t care as much about the opinion's of the people in the group

I’m less confident, less likable, and I believe less pleasant, when I’m among people who I have a sense are better than me. Either in intelligence, physique, popularity.... the list goes on.
