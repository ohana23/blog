    <p>SportAI is a sports analytics tool to democratize fantasy sports. It's a different take
      on a fantasy sports apps. Whereas most pack in as much information into single screens as
      much as possible, we designed SportAI with a different approach.
      <br><br>
      Aside from design,
      SportAI's main selling point is its backend machine learning algorithm which aims to
      predict athlete performance before their games.
      <br><br>
      I was the first designer at SportAI. I joined a team of 3 to revamp their design and
      build out the look and feel of the app.
