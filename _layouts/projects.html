                My teamâ€™s client sold large machines that were too large to ship and demo to customers and too complex to train new technicians with traditional manuals. We created an AR environment in which the client could use a HoloLens to create demos of the machine and produce interactive training guides for technicians. I led the UX discussions and helped code the frontend components.
