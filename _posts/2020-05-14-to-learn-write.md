## Frustration

Around the dawn of 2019, I noticed I was consuming way more media than I was creating. "This is a huge problem," I thought. "I should do something about this." 

Months passed. I did nothing.

Around the same time, I also noticed that I had trouble communicating ideas that I believed I knew a lot about. "I know a lot about this," I believed. "Yet I can't seem to discuss or explain it clearly in conversations."

It was frustrating.

"What the heck?!" I cried to the sky. "Why can I process thoughts about a topic just fine, but as soon as I have to put those thoughts into words, I'm about as easy to understand as [a Desiigner freestyle](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNymoBRmuZ8)? I already have my aunts and grandmas telling me I'm smart, but I wanna hear it from my friends, dammit."

## Discovery

Soon enough, I discovered this book. It's called *How to Take Smart Notes*, by SÃ¶nke Ahrens.
