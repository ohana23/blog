This is how we'd generate the cursor in a seemless way. Just force touch down on the screen.

To move the cursor, just swipe with your finger near the bottom of the screen. To tap, just tap near the same area.

Same thing when swiping to the left. Your finger can start on any portion of the x- or y-axis of the screen.

Getting rid of the cursor and back into your normal touch mode is simple, just swipe down towards the bottom of the screen.
