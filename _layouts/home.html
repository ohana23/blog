                    My team’s client sold large machines that were too large to ship and demo to customers and too
                    complex to train new technicians with traditional manuals. We created an AR environment in which
                    the client could use a HoloLens to create demos of the machine and produce interactive training
                    guides for technicians. I led the UX discussions and helped code the frontend components.

                    <p>The web is filled with inspirational design content if you know where to look. I find that
                        Twitter is super
                        helpful because it's filled with hard-working, passionate designers posting their work.
                        When I see something I like there, I'll save it to a list to view for later.
                        Mostly, though, I'll just play with CSS. It's like painting for me. The possibilities are
                        endless,
                        and the more I practice it, the more I'm inspired by what I can do with it.

                    <h1>What led you into software?</h1>
                    <p>The catalyst was probably seeing the first iPhone. My friend's mom had one and I was just
                        enamored by it. It was
                        one of those things you wanted really badly, and I think it was the first time I experienced
                        software that
                        was designed with so much thought. When I finally got one of my own (it was an iPhone 4), I'd
                        literally just
                        download apps all day. Though I didn't realize it then, I was setting myself up for an
                        appreciation of great software.

                    <p>After waking up and staring at my phone for way too long, I'll walk out onto my balcony to
                        stretch and think for a bit - preparing myself mentally for the day. Breakfast follows. I'll
                        then catch up
                        on some sprint work and do email stuff. For lunch, I'll cook up the fanciest thing I can think
                        of with the
                        not-so-fancy ingredients in my fridge. Work a bit more, do meetings, more email stuff. You get
                        it. After work
                        I'll practice some React or work on my website or get away from tech altogether by biking
                        through the beautiful
                        Washington D.C. When that's over with I'll finish, the day with a good movie or book.

                        constantly tend to.
                        My main browser is Safari, but for development I've been loving Brave. For general notes and
                        todos, I've been
                        hooked on Notion, and for real writing and thought synthesizing, Roam is where it's at.
                        Surprising nobody, my go-to
                        editor and mock-up software are VS Code and Figma.
