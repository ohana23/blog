I’ve been wanting to create a blog recently. A place for my notes - things I find interesting, important, and worth publicizing good information on. So, what better topic to do so than coronavirus.

## Full Disclosure

The information in Peter Attia’s latest podcast episode with vaccinology advocate Peter Hotez directly inspired the content of this article. While most of the information here is factual, some is speculation. But, any speculation comes from both Peters in this interview.

The discussion delved into some relatively technical word-soup that a layman like me finds hard to understand. In this article, I grabbed just the important bits. The bits that’ll stick with you and me. The bits we can bring up in counterpoints with our friends.

So let’s get started.

## Am I the only one who’s confused?

First things first. There’s a lot of information going around. It all comes from different sources. It all has varying degrees of believability. It’s hard to tell what’s fact and what’s fiction. Not to mention that each of us have our own knowledge of viruses (supported by evidence, or otherwise) that keeps us biased against certain pieces of information.

You’re not alone.

Immediately, Peter Attia admits to his naive opinions from just a few weeks ago that this virus wouldn’t become a big deal. Even he had to revamp perspectives, and although his focus might not dwell in virology, he’s a doctor dammit.

## As an individual, what can I do?

Nothing you haven’t heard before:

1. **Wash your hands.** With soap preferably (more info below on why soap > sanitizer).
2. **Don’t touch your face.** Eyes, ears and mouth especially. As far as we know, that’s how corona likes to get in.
3. **Keep your distance.** [Don’t hang around large groups of people if you can help it.](https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2020/world/corona-simulator/)

Anything that isn’t in the list above is barely worth mentioning. If some solution sounds too good to be true, it probably is. That means if a family member or ill-informed news correspondent says they found a cure to corona (like turning on a blow-drier and pointing it up your sinuses), figure out a nice way to correct them... I know that’s easier said then done.

## We’ve seen similar viruses in the past. What’s the big whoop about this one?

Peter Hotez dives into a number of reasons that make covid19 different.

**1. Transmissibility**

He first contrasts covid19 with what is essentially its predecessor virus, “SARS1”. SARS1 is known for shaking up the Chinese and Canadian economy in 2003. It had a high fatality rate and patients were hit with agonizing symptoms.

Peter argues this was a blessing in disguise. Since patients weren’t able to function and go about their day, they weren’t able to spread the virus as easily. Stronger symptoms keep people away from public spaces.

Hotez projects that for every person infected with covid19, roughly 2.5 more people will contract it. This is largely in part because it can survive unnoticed. Some patients don’t have symptoms. Some only feel slight, flu-like effects. Hence, patients go on about their day. That is, until a more vulnerable person contracts it.

**2. Fatality**

The fatality rate among those affected with coronavirus is 0.6% to 3.4% as of this writing. For seniors older than 70, the rate rockets to about 10% to 20%. This is what doctors in Wuhan projected and it lines up with what we’ve seen in a nursing home in Kirkland, WA where, out of about 100 seniors, 13 were killed. These percentages make covid19 10-20x more lethal than influenza.

## Will the change in seasons help reduce the virus’s spread?

Certainly some viruses have died down with the introduction of warmer seasons, but that isn’t the case for all of them. “We just don’t know”, says Hotez.

## Vaccines?

Nothing yet. Creating, testing, and approving a brand new vaccine could take anywhere up to 3 years. As Hotez puts it, vaccines are the big kahuna of medicinal solutions because they’re administered to otherwise healthy people - people who don’t yet have the virus.

Antivirals, or solutions administered to those already sick, are being studied as well.

Peter Hotez and his colleagues are looking at a variety of solutions for now. If you’d like to help by donating funds, keep reading.

## Can I help?

Here’s one thing you can do. Listen to the podcast and email Dr. Peter Hotez about how you can provide funding. They need money to carry on their research. Here’s his page and email:
