## Frustration

Around the dawn of 2019, I noticed that I had trouble communicating ideas that I believed I knew a lot about. "I know a lot about this," I believed. "Yet I can't seem to discuss or explain it clearly in conversations."
It was frustrating.

"What the heck?!" I cried to the sky. "Why can I process thoughts about a topic just fine, but as soon as I have to put those thoughts into words, I sound like [Desiigner freestyling](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNymoBRmuZ8)? I already have my aunts and grandmas telling me I'm smart, but I wanna hear it from my friends, dammit."

It was a genuine issue. Even when I thought I had a grasp on a talking point, there was no real point to me talking, and I struggled to make a point, and it felt like people were laughing at me in their heads. Laughing and pointing.
I'd had enough... I'd hit my breaking point.

## Perhaps a Solution

With the above points aside, I made it a point to overcome this issue.

Unfortunately, there was no clear solution. "Maybe it has to do with my speaking?" I wondered. Then I remembered two techniques I thought I heard someone in a TED talk recommend: speak slower and puff out your chest.

In the next discussion I had with friends, I gave those techniques a shot.

It was working. It was really working! I was like a young Steve Jobs. Making points here, making points there. "I should have started doing this a long time ago." I thought, grinning.

I gave my friends a second to pick up their jaws, as I was sure they were all on the floor.

"You okay? You're speaking really slow." said the first friend, jaw completely intact.
"What's wrong with his chest? It's all puffed out." said the second.
"That didn't make sense at all." said the third.

## Discovery

The trouble, I realized, lied not in my speaking, but in my understanding of the topics themselves.
Consuming information isn't sufficient. Even if I'm reading a lot or listening to the smartest podcasts or watching the best NatGeo episodes, it is simply not enough to consume and expect to learn.

__Real__ learning requires some form of __doing__.

And it turns out, the best, and easiest, form of doing is writing.

To truly understand a topic well enough to explain it to others, to form solid opinions on it, to contribute __new__ information to it, you have to write.

Writing is the greatest form of thinking. It is processing and gathering your thoughts. It is deep work. Moreso than simply thinking in your head. It is meditation and synthesization. 

Just by writing, you lead yourself down different paths of thoughts. Thoughts then lead to questions, which lead to more thoughts and questions. All along you improve the breadth and depth of your understanding of the topic and you start to make connections with that topic and other topics, which in turn improves your memory of both.

When I discovered writing, I thought it was the greatest thing since sliced bread.
